# Client Side Routing

### SWBATs:

- [ ] Review the difference between server-side and client-side routing
- [ ] Observe a refactor to include client-side routing using React Router V5
- [ ] Explain what a nested route is
- [ ] Observe how to handle nested client-side routes

## Deliverables

#### 1. Install and setup react router

- React Router has been updated to V6 but V5 is used in the curriculum.

- To install V5 run this command: `npm install react-router-dom@5.3.0` otherwise, V6 will install by default

V5 vs V6.0-6.2:
```js
// This is a React Router v5 app
import {
  BrowserRouter,
  Switch,
  Route,
  Link,
  useRouteMatch,
} from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/">
          <Home />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/users">
          <Users />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Users() {
  // In v5, nested routes are rendered by the child component, so
  // you have <Switch> elements all over your app for nested UI.
  // You build nested routes and links using match.url and match.path.
  let match = useRouteMatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to={`${match.url}/me`}>My Profile</Link>
      </nav>

      <Switch>
        <Route path={`${match.path}/me`}>
          <OwnUserProfile />
        </Route>
        <Route path={`${match.path}/:id`}>
          <UserProfile />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js
// This is a React Router v6 app
import {
  BrowserRouter,
  Routes,
  Route,
  Link,
} from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="users/*" element={<Users />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Users() {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to="me">My Profile</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path=":id" element={<UserProfile />} />
        <Route path="me" element={<OwnUserProfile />} />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Wrap the `App` component inside of the `BrowserRouter` component that will be imported from the `react-router-dom` library

#### 2. Use Switch and Route to set up initial routes so we can conditionally render components based on URL

- Import the `Switch` component from the `react-router-dom` library and wrap the components designated for routing

- Import the `Route` component from the `react-router-dom` library and wrap each individual component designated for routing

  - Provide the `path` prop to the `Route` component to create a URL path associated with the component

- Demonstrate each route in the browser to confirm desired expectation is occuring

- Demonstrate the use of the `exact` prop passed to the `Route` component

#### 3. Add navigation to the application using the `Link` and `NavLink` components

- Convert any html anchor tags to `Link` or `NavLink`

- Demonstrate the difference between `Link` and `NavLink`

#### 4. Create a nested route for the project show page inside of the `ProjectList` component
